# The following section defines the grid layout.
#
# Each row is an array of tiles descriptions.
# The top-left tile in this file maps to coordinates (0, 0) in the world
# Each tile contains a string with the kind of tile and its orientation.
# The orientations are North, South, East, West. This is the direction in
# which the agent is expected to drive when going onto this tile.

# The following is a listing of 3D objects placed on the map
#
# pos: object positions are scaled according to the tile size, so
#      that (1.5, 2.5) would be exactly in the middle of tile (1, 2)
# height: Objects can be scaled according to their real-world height in meters
#         Duckietown tiles are 61cm, or 0.61 meter
# rotate: the rotation angle determine the object's orientation
#         a positive rotation angle corresponds to a counter-clockwise
#         (leftward) rotation. The angles are in degrees.
#         Models should, at angle 0, face towards the positive X axis.
